# Runbook 05 — Demo walkthrough (10–15 minutes)

A click-by-click script for showing AnalystOS live: what to click, what to say, and what to do when a step is
slow or fails. It assumes the demo stack from `scripts/demo.ps1` (Windows) or `scripts/demo.sh`, which
brings everything up with Docker Compose and seeds a ready workspace with `analystos demo-seed`.

Evidence that this path works end to end, and what was and was not proven:
[`docs/60-delivery/evidence/2026-09-27-demo-readiness.md`](../60-delivery/evidence/2026-09-27-demo-readiness.md).

## 1. The night before

1. Docker Desktop running (WSL 2 backend), with at least **8 GB of memory** for the full stack
   (Settings → Resources). The full stack is Postgres, Redis, Temporal, Superset, the API, a worker, a scheduler,
   the web UI and the ServiceNow mock.
2. These host ports must be free: 5173 (web), 8000 (API), 8088 (Superset), 5432 (Postgres), 6379 (Redis),
   7233 (Temporal), 8090 (ServiceNow mock). A local Postgres service on 5432 is the usual clash: stop it
   (`Stop-Service postgresql*`) or use the lite path in §6.
3. From the repository folder, in PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   .\scripts\demo.ps1          # full stack; first build takes 10–20 minutes, later starts about 2 minutes
   ```

   If script execution is blocked: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\demo.ps1`.
   The script creates `.env` from `.env.example` if there is none (never commit `.env`), builds and starts the
   stack, waits for the API, the web UI and Superset, runs `analystos migrate`, `seed` and `demo-seed`, and prints
   the URLs, the logins and a one-line health summary. Every step is idempotent: run it again at any time.
4. Open the printed workspace link and click through §3 once, so browser caches and Superset are warm.
5. Keep two browser windows: a normal one signed in as the **analyst**, and a private one signed in as the
   **approver**. Keep a third tab on Superset (`http://localhost:8088`, `admin` / `admin`).

| What | Where | Sign in |
|---|---|---|
| Web UI | http://localhost:5173 | `analyst@analystos.local` / `ChangeMe123!` (runs work) |
| | | `approver@analystos.local` / `ChangeMe123!` (approves publication and KPIs) |
| | | `admin@analystos.local` / `ChangeMe123!` (administration) |
| Superset | http://localhost:8088 | `admin` / `admin` |
| API docs | http://localhost:8000/docs | |
| Health | http://localhost:8000/api/health | every dependency as `up`, `down` or `off` |

What `demo-seed` prepared in the workspace **ServiceNow Incident Intelligence (demo)**: the ServiceNow source
(the synthetic mock) with `incident` and `change_request` loaded; a filled workspace brief; one completed,
verified investigation with two dashboards published to Superset; a small CSV (`team_targets.csv`) with a
recipe (`team_capacity`); a weekly re-analysis schedule; and a volume-drift monitor. The investigation also
proposed seven KPI definitions, which wait in the approval inbox: they are part of the story in step 6.

**Do the demo in the seeded workspace.** It is created with the policy *require approved metrics* off, so a run
can publish KPIs it proposed itself (the v1 §62 scenario). A workspace you create live keeps the default (on): its
first Explain run verifies its findings and then stops at `publish_request`, because its KPIs are not approved yet.
If you do create one live, present that as the governance step it is: approve the proposed KPIs as the approver
(**Operate → Approval inbox → Approve a KPI definition**) and start the run again, or turn the policy off under
**Settings → Members & policy → Advanced**. Do not change the platform default.

## 2. If something is down: the status banner

The UI polls `/api/health` every 30 seconds. When a dependency the demo needs is down, a banner under the top
bar says which one and what it means, instead of pages spinning:

| Banner | Meaning | Fix (in a terminal, from the repository folder) |
|---|---|---|
| **API:** not responding | the API container is down or restarting | `docker compose ps`; `docker compose restart api` |
| **Worker:** no worker is running | runs stay queued (shown within about 2 minutes of the worker stopping) | `docker compose restart worker` |
| **Temporal:** unreachable | runs cannot start | `docker compose restart temporal`, then `worker` |
| **Superset:** not reachable | new publications go to the in-platform preview | `docker compose restart superset` (about 1 minute) |
| **Redis:** unreachable | model calls are refused (spend caps fail closed) | `docker compose restart redis` |

`docker compose` needs the same env files as the script; the short form is
`docker compose --env-file .env --env-file deploy/compose/demo.env --env-file deploy/compose/standard.env --env-file deploy/compose/bi.env --profile demo --profile standard --profile bi <command>`,
or simply re-run `.\scripts\demo.ps1`, which restarts whatever is missing.

## 3. The walkthrough

Timings are from the live evidence run on a loaded machine: an investigation reaches the approval step in
45–90 seconds and finishes 10–30 seconds after the approval.

### Step 1 — The workspace (1 min)

* **Click:** sign in as the analyst → the workspace card **ServiceNow Incident Intelligence (demo)**.
* **Say:** "A workspace is one business problem: its data, its brief, its people and its policy. The home page
  shows what needs me — here, KPI definitions waiting for an approver."
* **If slow:** the banner (§2) tells you which service is missing; carry on talking while it recovers.

### Step 2 — Governed data (1.5 min)

* **Click:** **Data → Sources**. Show the ServiceNow source (staged) and the CSV file source. Click **Columns** on
  `incident` to show the column list and tags.
* **Click:** **Data → Catalog & definitions → Brief & readiness**.
* **Say:** "Only the tables selected here are in scope. Every query — from agents, from Ask, from dashboards —
  goes through one gateway that parses it, checks it against this scope, runs it read-only with row caps and
  audits it. Restricted and PII columns are refused even through `SELECT *`. The brief records what the business
  told us — the question, the audience, what counts as out of scope — as reviewed facts the planner uses."
* **If slow:** skip to step 3; the brief is optional colour.

### Step 3 — Start a live investigation (3 min)

* **Click:** **Start work** (Overview) → **Explain** → keep the objective pre-filled from the workspace →
  **Data: ServiceNow** → point at **Before it starts** (what it reads, the spend cap, what needs a person) and
  **Is the data ready?** (*ready*: every required check passes, including the reviewed grain from the brief) →
  **Start investigation**.
* **Show:** the **Board** filling in (Proposed → Testing → Supported / Rejected / Inconclusive), then
  **Live events**.
* **Say:** "Models propose, code decides. Hypotheses come from a closed analysis vocabulary; each one compiles to
  SQL through the gateway and is tested with real statistics, corrected for multiple comparisons. Nothing a
  model writes reaches a number, a query or an approval without passing that deterministic path. With no model
  key at all — as here — every step takes its deterministic rung and says so."
* **Fallback (slow or failed run):** open **Work → Investigations** and the completed run that `demo-seed` made;
  everything below works on it. Say: "Here's one I ran before the session."

### Step 4 — Redirect it (1 min)

* **Click:** on the running investigation, in **Redirect the investigation**, type
  "Exclude inquiry-category incidents; they are requests, not operational failures." → **Send**.
* **Say:** "A person can steer at any time. The request becomes a filter, the plan is re-versioned and hashed,
  and any approval bound to the old plan is invalidated."
* **Fallback:** if the run already finished, show the same box on the completed run and explain it; don't wait.

### Step 5 — Why should I trust a finding? (2 min)

* **Click:** a **Supported** card → **Why trust this** (the checks: method fit, sample size, significance after
  correction, effect size, representativeness, wording) → **Why this number?** (the receipt: query, data
  fingerprint, method).
* **Click:** **Agent console** → the **Queries** tab (every SQL statement, hashed) and **Model calls** (each
  decision with the rung that answered it: rules, a small model or JEV).
* **Say:** "Every verified finding was re-run from its evidence query and checked by an independent method. If
  the data, the query or the semantics change, the verdict turns VOID by itself."

### Step 6 — Approval before anything leaves the platform (2 min)

* **Click (analyst):** wait for **Approvals → Publish dashboards** on the run (status *waiting for you*). Click
  **Approve** as the analyst: it is refused ("role 'editor' cannot approve").
* **Click (approver window):** **Operate → Approval inbox** → *… Publish dashboards* → **Approve**. The run
  finishes publishing within about 30 seconds; a second investigation in the same workspace updates the same two
  dashboards rather than creating new ones.
* **Say:** "Publishing is a side effect, so it needs a person with the approver role. The approval is bound to
  the hash of the exact bundle and the plan; if either changes, it must be approved again. The same inbox holds
  the KPI definitions this run proposed: approving one makes it a governed metric that Ask and dashboards reuse."
* **Optional:** approve one of the **Approve a KPI definition** items.
* **Fallback:** if the live run is not at the approval yet, show the approved publication on the seeded run.

### Step 7 — The dashboards (1.5 min)

* **Click:** on the run's **Result summary → Publication**, open **executive** and **operational**
  (Superset tab, `admin` / `admin`).
* **Say:** "Two dashboards, built from validated KPIs and charts chosen by rule. Superset reads the data through
  a per-workspace read-only login, and every tile traces back to its query and table (**Outputs** → a dashboard →
  lineage)."
* **Fallback (Superset down or slow):** the banner says "Superset is not reachable"; new publications then go to
  the **in-platform preview**, and the run's messages say so. Show **Outputs** → *executive dashboard* instead.
  Restart Superset in the background (§2).

### Step 8 — Keep watching (1.5 min)

* **Click:** **Operate → Monitors & alerts** → *Weekly incident volume drift* → **Evaluate now**.
* **Click:** **Operate → Schedules** → *Weekly incident review* → **Run now** (a re-analysis that re-tests
  every previous finding, diffs against the last run and writes a report; about a minute).
* **Say:** "Findings are not a one-off: schedules re-run the analysis on fresh data and report what is new,
  persisting, changed or resolved; monitors raise alerts, triaged by rules first, and can open an investigation
  automatically."
* **Fallback:** don't wait for the re-analysis; show the schedule's next run and move on.

### Step 9 — Prepare data and ask (1.5 min)

* **Click:** **Work → Prepare data** → recipe **team_capacity** → preview (filter, aggregate, quality gates).
* **Click:** **Work → Ask** → type "How many incidents are there by priority?" in **Question** → **Ask**. Show the
  labels (*Ad hoc analysis*, *Built from the catalog · no model*, *Validated by the query gateway*), the table and
  **Why these numbers?**. (The chips under **SQL console**, such as *Incidents by priority*, fill in read-only SQL
  for **Explain** / **Run** instead.)
* **Say:** "The same governance covers data preparation and quick questions: recipes compile to SQL with
  quality gates and lineage; Ask answers through the same gateway."

### Close (30 s)

"Governed data access, reproducible findings, people approving side effects, and a platform that tells you
plainly when a part of it is down."

## 4. Reset

* **Between rehearsals (keep data):** nothing to do; extra investigations and workspaces are harmless. Re-run
  `.\scripts\demo.ps1` (or `docker compose ... exec -T api analystos demo-seed`) to make sure every seeded piece is
  there.
* **Clean slate (deletes all demo data, about 3 minutes plus a first investigation):**

  ```powershell
  .\scripts\demo.ps1 -Reset
  ```

  This runs `docker compose down -v` (removes the Postgres volume, including Superset's metadata) and starts
  again from nothing.
* **Stop everything:** `.\scripts\demo.ps1 -Down` (data is kept).

## 5. Lite with Docker (no Temporal, no Superset)

`.\scripts\demo.ps1 -Lite` starts Postgres, the API (the local orchestrator runs investigations inside the API
process), the web UI and the ServiceNow mock. Publication goes to the in-platform preview; everything else in §3
works. Use it on a laptop with little memory, or when the full stack will not start.

## 6. Windows without Docker (lite, from source)

For a machine where Docker is not available. Tested here on Linux with the Windows-only gaps simulated
(`resource`, `fcntl`, `os.getuid`, `SIGKILL` and friends removed before import); not run on real Windows.

1. **Postgres 16 with pgvector.** Install PostgreSQL 16 (EDB installer). pgvector is not in the installer: build it
   from the *x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS* (as in the pgvector README):

   ```bat
   set "PGROOT=C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16"
   git clone --branch v0.8.0 https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector.git
   cd pgvector
   nmake /F Makefile.win
   nmake /F Makefile.win install
   ```

   If that is not possible, run only Postgres in Docker (`docker compose up -d postgres`) and continue at step 3.
2. **Databases and roles.** As the `postgres` superuser:

   ```powershell
   psql -U postgres -c "CREATE ROLE analystos LOGIN SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'analystos'"
   psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE analystos OWNER analystos"
   psql -U postgres -f deploy\postgres\01-init.sql
   psql -U postgres -d analystos -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector"
   psql -U postgres -d analytics -c "REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC; REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA public FROM analystos_reader;"
   ```

3. **Python 3.11 and the app** (PowerShell, repository folder):

   ```powershell
   py -3.11 -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\pip install -e ".[reports]"
   $env:ANALYSTOS_PROFILE = "lite"          # local orchestrator, in-process scheduler, no Redis/Temporal/Superset
   $env:SERVICENOW_PASSWORD = "admin"        # the mock source's development credential
   .venv\Scripts\analystos migrate
   .venv\Scripts\analystos seed
   ```

4. **Run** (three terminals; set the two `$env:` lines in each):

   ```powershell
   .venv\Scripts\uvicorn analystos.connectors.servicenow_mock:app --port 8090   # demo source
   .venv\Scripts\uvicorn analystos.api.app:app --port 8000                      # API
   cd web; npm install; npm run dev                                             # UI on http://localhost:5173
   ```

5. **Seed:** `.venv\Scripts\analystos demo-seed` (defaults: API `http://localhost:8000`, mock
   `http://localhost:8090`). It prints the workspace link.

Differences from the Docker stack: no Superset (publication goes to the preview), no worker (runs execute in the
API process and resume after a restart), and the Python sandbox is unavailable on Windows, so Python code steps in
notebooks are refused with the reason; investigations, Ask, recipes, schedules and monitors do not use it.

## 7. Running the live proofs yourself

With the stack up (full profile) and a Python 3.11 venv on the host (`pip install -e ".[dev]"`):

```powershell
$env:SERVICENOW_PASSWORD = "admin"
.venv\Scripts\python scripts\e2e_demo.py        # v1 §62: ServiceNow → findings → dashboards → approval → Superset
.venv\Scripts\python scripts\e2e_phase3.py      # schedules, reports, monitors (uses the workspace of the latest e2e report)
.venv\Scripts\python scripts\e2e_increment3.py  # any database, crawler, token economy
```

Each writes a dated report under `docs/60-delivery/evidence/`. Without `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, the phase 3 script
checks that alert triage was decided by rules and recorded (JEV cannot be proven without a key); with a key it
checks that JEV triaged the alert.
