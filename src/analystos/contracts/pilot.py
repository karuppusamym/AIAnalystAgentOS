"""Controlled-pilot readiness (P4-09, SEC-001..003, OPS-001..005).

A pilot workspace and each of its sources name two accountable people: the business owner (accepts the
decisions the outputs support) and the technical owner (keeps the source and its access working). They are
named people, not platform roles: an owner may have no AnalystOS account at all. Readiness lists what a
controlled pilot still lacks — a missing owner, an uncertified connector, a source in error, no single
sign-on mapping, no recovery drill — each with the reason and what to do; it never averages them away.
