"""The `Engine` protocol (spec v3 §7.1, ADR-0014, P4-E01).

An engine is *where* a validated statement runs: a source's own database (pushdown), the
analytics DB (staged snapshots) or a federating engine (DuckDB, later Trino/Spark). Engines sit
behind ``QueryGateway``; they are never called with SQL the validator has not produced, and they
never pick their own identity: the gateway hands them a ``ReaderIdentity`` built from the source's
least-privilege configuration (or the analytics reader). Writes are not part of this increment:
``plan_write`` / ``execute_write`` refuse until the BuildGateway (P4-E06) exists.

An engine is ``draft`` until its kind is certified against a live instance; the status is derived
from the connector evidence files (``connectors/certification.py``), never declared.
