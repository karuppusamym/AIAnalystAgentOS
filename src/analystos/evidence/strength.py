"""How far a supported finding clears its method's bars (P8-15).

A finding that only just passes is labelled ``weak`` so no reader takes it for an established fact. Seen
live: unit price "differed by order status" with rank-biserial 0.1175 against the 0.10 minimum and
q = 0.0028, on data where status was assigned at random. The label is computed from the statistic
alone, never by a model:

* ``margin`` = effect / the method's minimum effect for that effect measure (`skills.stats` thresholds);
  ratio measures (odds ratios, share ratios) compare on the log scale, so an odds ratio of 1.44 is
  2x the 1.2 minimum.
* ``weak``     margin < 1.5, or q >= alpha / 10 (q within a factor of 10 of alpha);
* ``strong``   margin >= 3 and q < alpha / 100;
* ``moderate`` otherwise. A measure with no minimum (Gini, robust z) is graded on q alone and is never
  ``strong``; with neither a threshold nor a p-value there is no grade (None).
