"""Dispatch outbox for runs (workbench API §4, P4-06).

`create_run` writes the run and a `dispatch_outbox` row in one transaction, then tries to dispatch at
once. Whatever happens after the commit, the row is the durable intent:

* crash before dispatch — the row is still `pending`; the relay (scheduler loop) starts the workflow;
* crash after dispatch, before the row was marked — the relay starts it again; the workflow id is
  stable (`analysis-<run>`), so Temporal answers "already started" and the run is only nudged, and the
  local orchestrator ignores a run it is already driving;
* orchestrator unavailable — the row stays pending with a backoff and the error; the relay retries;
* cancelled before dispatch — the relay never starts it and finishes the run as CANCELLED.

`reconcile` repairs what predates the outbox: a NEW run with neither an outbox row nor a workflow id.
