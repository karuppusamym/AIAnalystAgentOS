"""End work a dead process left "running" (Ask turns, ML experiments).

An Ask turn or an ML experiment runs inside the process that started it; if that process dies (a restart,
an OOM kill) the row stays `running` forever and the UI spins. The sweep marks rows older than a bound
that no live process could still be working on as failed, with a message that says what happened. It runs
at API startup and on every scheduler iteration; the bounds keep it from touching work still in flight in
another process.
