"""Temporal activities: thin wrappers over the orchestrator-agnostic engine (sync; thread or process pool).

Long activities heartbeat from a pump thread in the process that runs the work. A process that
stops scheduling Python threads (a statistic stuck in native code holding the GIL, a deadlock, a
frozen or killed pool process) stops heartbeating, and Temporal declares the attempt hung after the
queue's `heartbeat_seconds` instead of its `start_to_close_seconds`.
